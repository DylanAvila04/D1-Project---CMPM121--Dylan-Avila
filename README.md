# CMPM 121 D1 Project

Game Overview:
-Click the croissant to bake fresh pastries!
-Use your croissants to hire bakery staff and buy kitchen upgrades that increase croissant production automatically.
-Each upgrade improves your baking rate and increases in cost with each purchase, creating a satisfying incremental growth loop.

UI Inspirations & Credits:
Inspired by isschrack’s Planet destroy clicker
(https://github.com/isschrack/IncrementalGame_isschrack)
→ Adopted their vertical upgrade layout to organize shop buttons cleanly and improve player readability.

Inspired by jellyb3e' moose shooter clicker
(https://github.com/jellyb3e/cmpm-121-f25-d1-juliamanou)
→ Added a background image aesthetic similar to their hunting outdoors theme, giving my game a cozy bakery café vibe.
